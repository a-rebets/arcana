## 500

There was a problem on Asanaâ€™s end. In the event of a server error the response body should contain an error phrase. These phrases can be used by Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server error. Some errors are due to server load, and will not supply an error phrase.

**Content Types:**

#### application/json

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "project: Missing input",
      "help": "For more information on API status codes and how to handle them, read the docs on errors: https://asana.github.io/developer-docs/#errors'",

  ]

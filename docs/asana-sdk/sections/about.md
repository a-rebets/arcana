# Sections

A section is a subdivision of a project that groups tasks together. It can either be a header above a list of tasks in a list view or a column in a board view of a project.

Sections are largely a shared idiom in Asana’s API for both list and board views of a project regardless of the project’s layout.

The ‘memberships’ property when [getting a task](/reference/gettask) will return the information for the section or the column under ‘section’ in the response.

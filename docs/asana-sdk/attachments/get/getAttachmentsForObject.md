# GET /attachments

**Summary:** Get attachments from an object

**Description:** <b>Required scope: </b><code>attachments:read</code>

Returns the compact records for all attachments on the object.
There are three possible `parent` values for this request: `project`, `project_brief`, and `task`. For a project, an attachment refers to a file uploaded to the "Key resources" section in the project Overview. For a project brief, an attachment refers to inline files in the project brief itself. For a task, an attachment refers to a file directly associated to that task.

Note that within the Asana app, inline images in the task description do not appear in the index of image thumbnails nor as stories in the task. However, requests made to `GET /attachments` for a task will return all of the images in the task, including inline images.

**Operation ID:** getAttachmentsForObject

**Tags:** Attachments

## Query Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description | Default | Constraints |
|------|------|----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| opt_pretty | boolean | ❌ | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. | - | - |
| limit | integer | ❌ | Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100. | - | min: 1, max: 100 |
| offset | string | ❌ | Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. *Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.* | - | - |
| parent | string | ✅ | Globally unique identifier for object to fetch statuses from. Must be a GID for a `project`, `project_brief`, or `task`. | - | - |
| opt_fields | array | ❌ | This endpoint returns a resource which excludes some properties by default. To include those optional properties, set this query parameter to a comma-separated list of the properties you wish to include. | - | - |

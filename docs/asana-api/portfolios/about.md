# Portfolios

A portfolio gives a high-level overview of the status of multiple initiatives in Asana. Portfolios provide a dashboard overview of the state of multiple projects, including a progress report and the most recent [status update](/reference/status-updates).
Portfolios have some restrictions on size. Each portfolio has a max of 1500 items and, like projects, a maximum of 20 custom fields.
